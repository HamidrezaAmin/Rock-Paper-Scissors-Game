# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game! This interactive application allows you to play rock-paper-scissors against an artificial intelligence (AI) model through hand gesture recognition using your webcam.

## Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV installed on your system. These are essential for running the game and processing the images for gesture recognition.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several key directories:

- `train`: Contains training images for the model, categorized into subfolders for 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'.
- `test`: Houses testing images that are used to evaluate the model's performance, also categorized into 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'.

## Downloading and Using the Pre-trained Model

The AI model has already been trained and is ready for you to use. You can find the pre-trained model file `rps_model.h5` in the `master` branch of this repository. No additional training is required to start playing the game.

After cloning the repository, the model file `rps_model.h5` should be present in the root directory. Simply follow the instructions below to run the game using the pre-trained model.

## Running the Game

To start the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/HamidrezaAmin/rock-paper-scissors-game.git

2. Navigate to the directory:

3. Run the main script:


Make sure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.

## Training the Model

The AI model has been pre-trained with a dataset that includes a variety of hand gestures. If you would like to retrain the model with new data, you can use the images in the `train` directory.

## Testing the Model

Testing the model is straightforward. The game will automatically use the images in the `test` directory to evaluate the AI's performance and provide feedback on its accuracy.
